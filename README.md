# web-crawling
This web crawler is programmed with python. From a website called "gsmarena.com", I fetch some mobile phone data for my personal use.
from the .txt file named "phone_links.txt", I get the specific phones link of that website. And get data form that page. And save then in a csv file.
csv file is automatic created when program is compile.
